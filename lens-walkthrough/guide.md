## Profiles

Create a profile

```sh
npx hardhat create-profile --network localhost
```



What is the model I am building? 


Announcement is authored by a user but posted on another profile.
e.g. 



Publication
    Name - “#announcements”
    Owner - lens.eth
    Authors - (samantha.eth,)
Post
    Author - samantha.eth
    Content
    Publication: #123213
User
    Following
    Inbox



Channel
    title
        non-unique name like "Announcements"
    author module
        users that are authorised to post within the channel
    has many posts
    has one owner



I imagine the space will go something like this: 
- capacity is lagging us 





Something like:
- create publisher
- onboard spaniard on as a follower

really we want the daos to be using discord feeds
we don't want them to have to post twice (?)
