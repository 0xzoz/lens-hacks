An open web3 inbox where I can see all my project announcements in one place.

Built atop [Lens Protocol](https://lens.dev/).
## Plan.

This development process is organised by sprints. Each sprint I intend to build in public, create value for someone, and learn. 

See the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/rnDb4hvCABecXdxIe14855/lenshacks?node-id=0%3A1) for product research, validation and wireframes.
### Sprint 1: Discovering Lens Protocol

* Create profile
* Create publication
* Publish to it
* Follow it
* Publish another thing to it
### Sprint 2: Building out a prototype.

The open inbox.

* Login with Web3
* Inbox (show posts from following)
### Sprint 3: 

Publications for creators.

* Create a publication (manual URL).
* Post to your publication.
* Edit your publication's settings.
### Sprint 4: 

Publications for followers.

* View publication page.
* Follow/unfollow publication.

## Risks

 * How expensive are transactions in Lens? Would it be cheaper to deploy elsewhere, or self-host the chain? 
 * What sort of indexing infrastructure does Lens provide? Will we need to roll our own?
 * Is the one-transaction-per-interaction going to be a major UX impediment for users? Can we get around this using a 3box-style approach?
